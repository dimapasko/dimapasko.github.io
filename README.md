# About

Passionate architect and successful team leader with over 15 years of experience in commercial software development with various technologies and stacks.
 
Successfully drove a transformation of a large monolithic application to a set of microservices hosted in a private cloud with Kubernetes orchestration. As a result of this transformation, the large set of DevOps practices has been adopted in the organization, allowing faster time-to-market for independently releasing features and functionality updates, providing better agility and higher quality of the release process.

With the participation in dozens of high-complexity projects, including building software used by Fortune 500 companies, I mastered and proved my skills in coaching my peers and leading teams of different sizes. I'm dedicating myself fully to building great software, utilizing and implementing the best practices in various aspects of the software development and maintenance process, from the lifecycle management, gathering and documenting requirements, planning and forecasting, to selecting and implementing the proper architecture decisions to support business requirements.

Full stack, end to end, polyglot. Design, implementation, testing, UX, CI/CD, DevOps, Security Audit.

Competent speaker with experience from different software development and IT conferences in Ukraine.
